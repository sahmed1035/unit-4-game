## Getting Started

The CrystalsCollector game:

fun and interactive game for web browsers that dynamically updates  HTML pages with the jQuery library.
-Arrays
-Random Number Generator

The app shows the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
   -The random number shown at the start of the game is between 19 - 120.
   -Each crystal is assigned a random hidden value between 1 - 12 each time a new game is start.

## Running the tests

The player will have to guess the random generated number answer. 

Here's how the app works:

   
   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
   * There are four crystals buttons are displayed.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

   * The game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
   * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

   *  When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
